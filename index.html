<h2>VanossGaming</h2>

	Evan Fong (born 31 May 1992), known online as VanossGaming (or simply Vanoss), is a Canadian internet personality, video game commentator, music producer, and DJ. He posts montage-style videos on YouTube of him and other creators playing various video games, such as Grand Theft Auto V and Garry's Mod. Aside from this, he produces music and performs as a DJ under the name Rynx, and served as a creative director for the video game Dead Realm, and as a voice actor for the YouTube Premium series Paranormal Action Squad and the upcoming animated series Alpha Betas.
</p>

<p>
	
	Fong was born on 31 May 1992 and raised in Toronto, Ontario. Fong is of Asian descent, his mother being Korean, and father Chinese. Fong graduated from Richmond Hill High School and studied economics in college, but he later dropped out in his second year to focus on his YouTube channel as a full-time commitment.[1] Fong claimed that his parents were initially concerned that he was neglecting his studies in favor of producing content for his YouTube channel, admitting that "Even though there's a lot of potential for somebody starting a YouTube channel it's obviously not a guaranteed path.".[1]

During his early years on YouTube, he met several other creators who would eventually become frequently featured in his videos. His channel achieved popularity soon after, and by 2015 it had surpassed 10 million subscribers. In the same year, he appeared at PAX East and signed a contract with Jetpak. His logo, an owl in the shape of the letter "V", modeled after his character in Grand Theft Auto V, is one of his most recognizable symbols.

Fong claimed that he was not introduced to video games at a young age, but that he played games "here and there" which included children's adventure and puzzle titles such as Freddi Fish and Pajama Sam.

Outside of his YouTube career, Fong continues to play ice hockey recreationally, plays airsoft or other tournaments, and also plays the guitar as another hobby.

On April 30, 2015, Fong announced on Twitter that he had signed with Jetpak, a multi-channel network founded by Adam Montoya and Tom Cassell.[2]

On November 26, 2015, Fong announced that he was releasing a new logo for the VanossGaming brand. He released the logo later that day along with limited edition merchandise released the day after. The logo was a white minimalistic design of an owl on a black background. There is also a diagonal cut through the design, creating a black letter "V". The owl design represented the owl mask on Fong's character model in Grand Theft Auto Online.

Fong's content has earned him two award nominations, including a Shorty Award for Tech and Innovation, under the category of Gaming. He has been recognized as a central figure in the subculture of video game commentary, with publications attributing his massive popularity to his sense of authenticity. As of April 2020, Fong's channel has over 12 billion views and 25.0 million subscribers,[3] making it the 95th most subscribed channel on YouTube.[4]
